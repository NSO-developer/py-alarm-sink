* Skeletons for NSO in Docker git repositories
  The directories herein are repository skeletons for the standard forms of repositories in the NID (NSO in Docker) ecosystem, specifically:

  - *ned*: a repository skeleton for the standard form of NID NED repos
  - *package*: generally for repositories containing one or more packages, except for NEDs which are better served by the NID ned standard form
  - *system*: for working with an NSO system
  - *lsa-system*: for working with an NSO LSA system

  To get started, create your new project directory and copy the content of the skeleton into the directory. See the skeleton README file for more information.
